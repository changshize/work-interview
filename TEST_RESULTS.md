```

### 3. API Endpoint Tests

#### Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```
**Result:** ‚úÖ SUCCESS
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-25T16:41:26.743487",
  "services": {
    "speech_to_text": "healthy",
    "translation": "healthy", 
    "ai_generation": "healthy",
    "audio_capture": "healthy"
  },
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

#### Speech-to-Text Service
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/transcribe" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"audio_data": "dGVzdCBhdWRpbw==", "language": "en", "provider": "mock"}'
```
**Result:** ‚úÖ SUCCESS
```json
{
  "text": "This is a mock transcription for testing purposes.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "language": "en", 
  "processing_time": 0.10147285461425781,
  "provider": "mock"
}
```

#### Translation Service
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/translate" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Hello world", "source_language": "en", "target_language": "zh", "provider": "mock"}'
```
**Result:** ‚úÖ SUCCESS
```json
{
  "original_text": "Hello world",
  "translated_text": "[‰∏≠ÊñáÁøªËØë] Hello world",
  "source_language": "en",
  "target_language": "zh",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "processing_time": 0.10042142868041992,
  "provider": "mock"
}
```

#### AI Answer Generation
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/generate-answer" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "Tell me about yourself", "style": "professional", "max_length": 150, "language": "en", "provider": "mock"}'
```
**Result:** ‚úÖ SUCCESS
```json
{
  "question": "Tell me about yourself",
  "answer": "I am a dedicated professional with strong communication skills and a passion for continuous learning. I believe my experience and enthusiasm make me a great fit for this role.",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "processing_time": 0.20084238052368164,
  "provider": "mock",
  "metadata": {
    "style": "professional",
    "language": "en",
    "original_length": 175,
    "processed_length": 175
  }
}
```

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Working Features
1. **FastAPI Backend Server** - Starts and runs correctly
2. **Mock Service Providers** - All three core services (STT, Translation, AI) work with mock data
3. **REST API Endpoints** - All endpoints respond correctly
4. **Configuration System** - Environment-based configuration works
5. **Error Handling** - Graceful fallback to mock providers when real services unavailable
6. **Health Monitoring** - Health check endpoint provides service status

### ‚ùå Not Yet Tested
1. **Frontend React Application** - Requires Node.js setup
2. **WebSocket Real-time Communication** - Needs frontend to test
3. **Audio Capture** - Requires PyAudio installation
4. **Real AI Services** - Needs actual API keys
5. **End-to-End Pipeline** - Full audio ‚Üí transcription ‚Üí translation ‚Üí answer flow

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues
1. **PyAudio Missing** - Audio capture disabled, needs `pip install pyaudio` or system audio libraries
2. **No Real API Keys** - Using mock providers only
3. **Frontend Not Built** - React app not tested
4. **Deprecation Warnings** - FastAPI on_event decorators deprecated

## Next Steps for Full Testing

1. **Install Audio Dependencies**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev python3-pyaudio
   pip install pyaudio numpy scipy
   ```

2. **Setup Frontend**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

3. **Add Real API Keys** (for production testing)
   ```bash
   # Add to .env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_real_key
   GOOGLE_TRANSLATE_API_KEY=your_real_key
   ```

4. **Test WebSocket Connection**
   - Start backend server
   - Start frontend application  
   - Test real-time audio processing

## Conclusion

The **core backend architecture is working correctly**. The modular design with mock providers allows the system to run and be tested even without external dependencies. This demonstrates that:

- The code structure is sound
- The API design is functional
- The service abstraction works properly
- Error handling and fallbacks are implemented correctly

The system is ready for integration testing with real services and frontend development.
