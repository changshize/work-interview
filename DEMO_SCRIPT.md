# Demo Script - Real-Time Interview Assistant

## Current Status (Honest Assessment)

### ‚úÖ What's Working
- **Backend API Server**: Fully functional FastAPI server
- **Mock Services**: All three core services (STT, Translation, AI) working with mock data
- **REST API Endpoints**: All endpoints tested and responding correctly
- **Configuration System**: Environment-based config with fallbacks
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when services unavailable

### ‚ùå What's Not Working Yet
- **Frontend**: React app not tested (requires Node.js setup)
- **Real-time Audio**: No audio capture (PyAudio not installed)
- **Real AI Services**: Using mock providers only (no API keys)
- **WebSocket**: Not tested without frontend
- **End-to-End Flow**: Full pipeline not demonstrated

## Demo Commands (What Actually Works)

### 1. Start Backend Server
```bash
cd backend
python3 -m app.main
```
**Expected Output:**
```
INFO: Starting Real-Time Interview Assistant...
INFO: Skipping API key validation in debug/test mode
INFO: Initialized STT providers: ['mock']
INFO: Initialized translation providers: ['mock'] 
INFO: Initialized AI providers: ['mock']
INFO: All services initialized successfully
INFO: Uvicorn running on http://localhost:8000
```

### 2. Test Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```
**Expected Output:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "services": {
    "speech_to_text": "healthy",
    "translation": "healthy",
    "ai_generation": "healthy", 
    "audio_capture": "healthy"
  }
}
```

### 3. Test Speech-to-Text (Mock)
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/transcribe" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"audio_data": "dGVzdA==", "language": "en", "provider": "mock"}'
```
**Expected Output:**
```json
{
  "text": "This is a mock transcription for testing purposes.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "language": "en",
  "processing_time": 0.1,
  "provider": "mock"
}
```

### 4. Test Translation (Mock)
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/translate" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Hello", "target_language": "zh", "provider": "mock"}'
```
**Expected Output:**
```json
{
  "original_text": "Hello",
  "translated_text": "[‰∏≠ÊñáÁøªËØë] Hello",
  "source_language": "auto",
  "target_language": "zh",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "provider": "mock"
}
```

### 5. Test AI Answer Generation (Mock)
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/generate-answer" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "Why do you want this job?", "style": "professional", "provider": "mock"}'
```
**Expected Output:**
```json
{
  "question": "Why do you want this job?",
  "answer": "I am excited about this opportunity because it aligns perfectly with my career goals and allows me to contribute my skills while growing professionally.",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "processing_time": 0.2,
  "provider": "mock"
}
```

## What This Demonstrates

### ‚úÖ Proven Capabilities
1. **Solid Architecture**: Modular, extensible design
2. **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with proper schemas
3. **Service Abstraction**: Clean separation between providers
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and error responses
5. **Configuration**: Flexible environment-based setup
6. **Testing**: Mock providers allow development without external deps

### üîÑ Ready for Integration
1. **Real AI Services**: Just need API keys to switch from mock to real
2. **Audio Processing**: PyAudio installation will enable real audio
3. **Frontend**: React app is built, needs Node.js to run
4. **WebSocket**: Backend ready, needs frontend to test real-time flow

## Next Development Steps

### Immediate (< 1 hour)
1. Install Node.js and test frontend
2. Install PyAudio for audio capture
3. Test WebSocket connection

### Short-term (< 1 day)  
1. Add real API keys and test with actual services
2. End-to-end testing with real audio
3. UI/UX improvements

### Medium-term (< 1 week)
1. Performance optimization
2. Additional language support
3. Advanced features (caching, analytics)

## Honest Assessment

**This is a working proof-of-concept** that demonstrates:
- Sound software architecture
- Functional API design  
- Proper error handling
- Extensible service design

**It's not yet a complete application** because:
- Frontend needs testing
- Real services need integration
- Audio capture needs setup
- End-to-end flow needs validation

**But the foundation is solid** and ready for rapid development to full functionality.

## Recording Notes

When recording the demo:
1. Show the backend starting successfully
2. Demonstrate each API endpoint working
3. Explain what's mock vs real
4. Show the code structure
5. Be honest about current limitations
6. Highlight the solid foundation for future development
